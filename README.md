# shockdetector

This app was built by Sahil Hamal and Robert Morea of Troy University for hackGSU in March '16.  We also had a third guy helping us,
but I don't recall his name (if Sahil remembers, I'll add it)!

It is very basic as it is our first android app (and first hackathon), so we actually spent half the day struggling to install the 
dev environment.

The intent was to use the android as a proxy for a sensor that could be included inside a shipping container.  It records shocks,
along with the time, so that damage can be traced to particular events.

We had intended to add other functions, such as whether the container was ever turned upside down, etc., and also make the app report 
to a server, but we didn't have time and/or didn't get those things working (maybe we'll still add them as an exercise).
